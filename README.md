# AirBnB Clone
## Project Description
The **AirBnB** clone project is a software project aimed at creating a simplified version of the popular vacation rental platform, Airbnb.The interpreter is implemented in Python and allows users to enter commands and receive feedback based on their input.

## Command Interpreter Description
The command interpreter is started by running the console.py file. This will launch the interpreter and display a prompt where users can enter commands.


Commands can be entered using the following format:
> *command_name [arg1] [arg2] ... [argN]*


The interpreter will then execute the appropriate command and provide feedback based on the command's output.

## How To Start The Interpreter
To start the interpreter, navigate to the directory containing the console.py file and run the following command in your terminal:
> *python3 console.py*
>> *or*

> *./console.py*


This will launch the interpreter and display the prompt.

## How to Use the Interpreter
Once the interpreter is running, you can enter commands in the following format:
> *command_name [arg1] [arg2] ... [argN]*


The interpreter will then execute the appropriate command and provide feedback based on the command's output.
To exit the interpreter, simply enter the **exit** command.

## Examples:
> **create BaseModel** \# Creates a new instance of BaseModel, saves it (to the JSON file) and prints the id.


> **how BaseModel 1234-1234-1234** \# Prints the string representation of an instance based on the class name and id."


> **update BaseModel 1234-1234-1234 email "aibnb@mail.com"** \# Updates an instance based on the class name and id by adding or updating attribute.


> **destroy BaseModel 1234-1234-1234** \# Deletes an instance based on the class name and id.


> **all BaseModel** \# Prints all string representation of all instances based or not on the class name.
